# AMPEL WebDAV syncer

# February 2020
#
# The WebDAV repository stores AMPEL TransientViews as gzipped JSON files that
# are updated as new data are added to each object. Each time the exporter
# process updates a file, it records that in an update manifest stored at e.g.
# $BASE_URL/$CHANNEL_NAME/manifests/latest.json.gz. The manifest is of the form
# {
#    "time": timestamp,
#    "previous": url of previous manifest (or null),
#    "updated": list of TransientView URLs
# }
# Previous manifests are saved according to date and can be reached through the 
# chaining the previous manifest field.
#
# This script will examine the remote manifest repository and download any updates
# recorded in manifest files not locally available. The manifests will also be saved.
#
# Finally, this script will also retrieve the latest macaroon available on the remote system.
# These are updated every 24h and expires after 48h; this script thus needs to be run 
# for each channel at least every 48h.
#
# This script requires curl, gzip, sed, and jq	
#
# TODO: Be more interactive as to which channel is being updated and where files go.
# TODO: Ensure that each manifest file is only downloaded once (to temp storage then move)
# TODO: A more thorough check that the remote and local manifest structure/times agree.
